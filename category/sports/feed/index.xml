<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Here&#8217;s how the comedy of errors ensued between Rahul and Pant:</strong></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">After Pant-115-run Rahul&#8217;s fourth-wicket stand, India will be hard-pressed to score more than 300 in the second and penultimate ODI. While Pant was out for 85, missing out on a century, Rahul fell for a 79-ball 55 against the run of play.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">India already lost the first One-Day International (ODI) on Wednesday. The visitors were restricted for 265-8 in their full quota of overs while chasing 297 and will need to up their game to level the series.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Rishabh Pant, an Indian wicketkeeper/batsman, smashed 85 in the second One-Day International (ODI) against South Africa on Friday (January 21).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Pant took just 71 balls to make 85 and appeared to be on his way to his first ODI century before a loose shot against Tabraiz Shamshi cost him his wicket.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, his 85-run home run was enough to put him in the record books.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">His 85th ODI score in South Africa is now the highest by an Indian wicketkeeper.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Pant passed Rahul Dravid to become the 78th player to reach the milestone. MS Dhoni (65), Rahul Dravid (62), and Saba Karim are the other Indians on the list (55).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">India needs to win the second ODI to keep the series alive after losing the first. India won the toss and chose to bat first, but Dhawan fell early and Kohli also fell for naught.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Pant and Rahul came together and put on a 115-run stand for the third wicket, but SA struck again, taking back-to-back wickets of Rahul and Pant to end India&#8217;s innings.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Virat Kohli of India achieved two massive feats during the first ODI of the series against South Africa on Wednesday in Paarl. Kohli, in his first ODI since being replaced as full-time captain by Rohit Sharma, surpassed India legend Sachin Tendulkar as well as skippers Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid for two incredible records.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Soon after coming to bat in the 297-run chase, the former India captain broke Sachin Tendulkar&#8217;s record for most runs in a way ODIs for the team. Tendulkar had 5,065 runs in away ODIs, and Kohli has now surpassed the Indian legend to take third place in the all-time list of most away runs in the fifty-over format. While Sri Lanka&#8217;s Kumar Sangakkara (5,518) is far ahead, Kohli can overtake Ricky Ponting (5,090) to finish second.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Prior to the first ODI, the Indian captain had 1,287 runs against the Proteas, surpassing two Indian batting legends â€“ Dravid and Ganguly â€“ as he reached the 27th run of his innings. Tendulkar, who has scored 2,001 runs against South Africa in ODIs, is only one run behind the former Indian captain. Tendulkar&#8217;s record against the Proteas is also the best for a batter against the Proteas in general.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Virat Kohli is now the sixth-highest run-scorer against South Africa on the all-time list. Kohli trails Ricky Ponting (1,879), Kumar Sangakkara (1,789), Steve Waugh (1,581), and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (1,581). (1,559).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Kohli is not captaining the Indian team for the first time in nearly five years, regardless of the format. Last week, the 33-year-old shocked the cricket world by announcing his intention to step down as captain of the side in Test cricket. The announcement came just one day after India lost a 1-2 Test series to South Africa.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Earlier, South Africa posted 296/4 in the first ODI, with captain Temba Bavuma and Rassie van der Dussen scoring centuries. The hosts won the toss and chose to bat in Paarl, and the Indian bowlers were indifferent, with the exception of Jasprit Bumrah, who was the most economical in the attack.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Venkatesh Iyer made his ODI debut, and senior off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin returned to the team after a four-year absence.</p>
