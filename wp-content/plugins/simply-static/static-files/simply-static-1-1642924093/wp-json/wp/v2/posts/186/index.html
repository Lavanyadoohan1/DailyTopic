There will be more clarity once they deliver the report. There is no provision for compensation for vaccination-related deaths, but there is one under the Chief Minister&#8217;s Relief Fund that meets certain criteria.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">&#8220;We will recommend compensation to the Joint Secretary,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">An initial investigation into the deaths of the three babies has revealed that the nurse who obtained the vaccination vials from the pharmacist on Tuesday had kept them in a hotel fridge with food items, violating all protocols.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">This resulted in bacterial infection, and the three babies died as a result of aseptic shock syndrome after receiving these vaccines. On January 12, two people died after being vaccinated at the Bochagala camp, and one person died on January 11 at the Mallapura camp in Ramdurg taluk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">At Bochagala, 17 babies were vaccinated, and four babies were vaccinated at Mallapura. Two girls, one 18 months old and the other 12 months old, are being treated in the hospital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">K. Sudhakar, Karnataka&#8217;s Health Minister, had ordered the suspension of nurse Salma and pharmacist Jayaram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">According to Eshwar Gadad, the vaccination vials must be taken from the primary health centre (PHC) to vaccination camps and then returned to the PHC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">&#8220;Nurse Salma should not have transported the vials and stored them in a hotel refrigerator. All of the vials she obtained have been returned and tested. This is a regrettable occurrence. The health department has taken care of it, and parents can come forward to have their babies vaccinated &#8220;He continued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Pavithra Halagur, a 13-month-old baby girl, died the same day after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, after experiencing nausea and vomiting a few hours later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Umesh Karagundi, a 14-month-old child, was admitted to Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences but died on January 15 due to convulsions in the intensive care unit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Chetana, a 15-month-old baby who received the vaccine jab in the Mallapura camp, died on January 15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Children under the age of 15 months receive the first dose of measles-rubella vaccine, and those over the age of 15 months receive a second dose.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Belagavi District Commissioner MG Hiremath announced on Wednesday (January 19) that he had submitted a preliminary investigation report to Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai in the case of three babies who died after receiving measles-rubella vaccines in the district. &#8220;The discussion is about compensating the families who lost their babies,&#8221; he added.
