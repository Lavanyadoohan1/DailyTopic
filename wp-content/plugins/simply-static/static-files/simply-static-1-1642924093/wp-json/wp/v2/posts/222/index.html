However, Oppo, one of the world&#8217;s largest technology companies, believes that batteries are not the future, at least for IoT devices such as wireless earphones. It has now outlined a vision in which such devices will be powered by mobile signals, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth rather than batteries, which could change the way we use these products. Oppo has released a research paper titled &#8220;Zero Power Consumption Communication,&#8221; which focuses on a system that includes devices that consume no power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Although it is only a theory at this point, the zero power consumption communication system will not use batteries for power and will instead rely on waves for charging. These devices will be ultra-portable and require much less power to operate, and with a battery-free mechanism, they will be longer-lasting and less expensive than current technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Batteries are an essential component of any personal electronic device that people carry with them. In contrast to the direct power supply system found on large appliances such as televisions and refrigerators, batteries enable devices to be portable. However, the way batteries work has several limitations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The first and most important limitation is that they are consumable, which means they will become less effective and lose capacity as they age. Second, they take up a lot of room. If you&#8217;ve ever looked inside a smartphone, you&#8217;ll notice that the battery takes up the most space. They are also quite heavy. Given that they both use the same build material, a phone with a 6000mAh battery will most likely weigh more than a phone with a 4000mAh battery. Third, batteries are costly and add to the overall cost of your phone. Fourth, batteries are vulnerable to damage and explosions if the environment in which they operate changes slightly. You&#8217;ve probably heard about phones exploding. Finally, batteries are harmful to the environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Oppo wants to change everything. It has proposed technology for collecting radiofrequency energy from wireless connections such as mobile networks, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, which originate from RF sources such as TV towers, FM towers, mobile network base stations, and Wi-Fi hotspots. By modulating and relaying incoming signals, they will be able to communicate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">What Oppo has envisioned appears efficient and promising, and if implemented, could improve the ease with which we use some gadgets. However, it will mostly be limited to devices with low energy requirements, so it is difficult to imagine zero power consumption communication technology being able to power devices such as smartphones.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether it&#8217;s a mobile phone, a laptop, a tablet, or earbuds, nearly every personal gadget today is powered by a battery.
