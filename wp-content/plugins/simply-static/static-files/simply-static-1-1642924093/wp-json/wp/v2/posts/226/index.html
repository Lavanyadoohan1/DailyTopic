Samsung promises that the next generation flagships will provide a better user experience. Samsung President TM Roh hinted in a blog post that the Galaxy S series could include a Note-series-like device as well. It is also expected to unveil its new Galaxy Tab S8 tablets at the event. Here&#8217;s a rundown of everything Samsung is expected to reveal next month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The date of the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2022 event has been leaked.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">While the company has yet to confirm the event date, Ice Universe, a well-known leaker, claimed on Weibo that Samsung will hold its Galaxy Unpacked 2022 event on February 9. However, according to a report in the Korean publication DDaily, the event could begin on February 8. According to reports, the event will begin at 23:00 PM CST, which is 8:30 PM in India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What can we expect from the Samsung Unpacked 2022 event?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is widely rumored to be the new Samsung Galaxy Note series phone this year, something that the company&#8217;s President has also hinted at. The terms &#8220;notable S series&#8221; and &#8220;the next evolution of Galaxy&#8221; both refer to the same thing. The company has also posted a short video on YouTube, implying that the brand intends to offer a mix of Galaxy S and Note series, which the Galaxy S22 Ultra may offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">&#8220;At Unpacked in February 2022, we&#8217;ll unveil the most notable S series device we&#8217;ve ever created.&#8221; &#8220;The next generation of Galaxy S is here, combining the best of our Samsung Galaxy into one ultimate device,&#8221; he wrote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">&#8220;We understand that many of you were disappointed when Samsung did not release a new Galaxy Note last year. You adored the Galaxy Note series&#8217; unrivaled creativity and efficiency, which allowed you to transition from gaming nirvana to high-octane productivity in the blink of an eye. You gushed about the lifelike S Pen, which many compare to writing with ink on paper. And we haven&#8217;t forgotten about the things you enjoy,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Samsung is expected to release three smartphones this year, including the Galaxy S22, Galaxy S22 Plus, and Galaxy S22 Ultra. The top-tier Ultra model is said to have a unique design. It may resemble Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Note phablets and include an S-Pen slot. According to previous rumors and leaks, this one will also have a curved display, similar to the Galaxy Note 20. The Galaxy S22 Ultra may have a large 6.81-inch screen. A 5,000mAh battery and a 108-megapixel quad-camera setup were also visible. A 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 10-megapixel 10x telephoto camera, and a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera are said to be included.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">In some countries, all three Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphones will most likely be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. In India, the company could release devices with its new Exynos 2200 SoC and AMD graphics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The Galaxy S22 and its Plus variant are also expected to get camera upgrades, such as a beefier primary camera and improved optical zoom. Both handsets are expected to keep the old design and include a 50MP GN5 primary camera on the back. The standard model is expected to have a 6.01-inch screen, while the Plus is expected to have a 6.55-inch display.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Roland Quandt, a tipster, recently suggested that the company&#8217;s 2022 flagship could finally offer faster-charging speeds. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra model is expected to support 45W charging. However, because Samsung does not include a charger in the box of its flagship phones, the charging brick may have to be purchased separately. Furthermore, the other two models are said to have only 25W fast charging, which is similar to older models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 series, in addition to the Galaxy S22 series, is expected to make its debut at the upcoming Unpacked 2022 event. While few details are known about the tablet&#8217;s specifications, it is expected to be powered by a Snapdragon 888 or Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. Three models could be unveiled by the company. The standard model is expected to have an 11.6-inch screen, while the Plus model may have a 12-inch screen. The Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra could have a massive 14.6-inch screen when it launches.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The launch of the Samsung Galaxy S22 series is just around the corner, with the company confirming that its Unpacked 2022 event will take place in February.
