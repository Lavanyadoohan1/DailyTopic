The procedure was described in a scientific paper published on January 20 in the American Journal of Transplantation \u2014 the first time a pig-to-human transplant procedure had been published in a peer-reviewed journal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The study addressed critical safety and feasibility issues in xenotransplantation or transplanting organs from one species into another, and the findings pave the way for future and immediate clinical trials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The pig&#8217;s organs had been genetically modified to be more compatible with human bodies and less likely to be rejected. The researchers also discovered no infection in the man caused by pig viruses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The kidneys produced urine but were unable to remove creatinine from the blood, as a normal functioning kidney would. The researchers believe this is due to the brain injury suffered by the patient, James Parsons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Parsons had been declared dead five days before, and the experiment was called off when other organs began to fail and he began to severely bleed 77 hours into it. At no point were the kidneys rejected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong><strong>The investigation<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The &#8216;Parsons Model&#8217; is the name given by the surgeons&#8217; team to their pre-clinical model experiment, which will take place in late September 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The pig&#8217;s genome had ten modifications. Two human genes were inserted to prevent rejection, two for anticoagulation (blood clot prevention), and two for immunomodulatory (immune system regulation).\\<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Three pig carbohydrate antigen genes, as well as the pig growth hormone receptor gene, were deleted. Pigs that have been genetically modified in this way are also compatible with all human blood types because they lack red blood cell antigens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Parsons had been declared dead and brain dead for five days prior to the experiment. He had suffered mild-to-moderate kidney damage as well as head trauma. His family agreed to the procedure after exhausting all other transplant options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">While both transplanted kidneys functioned normally, one produced more urine than the other. Creatinine levels in the body did not decrease, as they normally do in healthy kidneys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The researchers do not yet know what is causing either of these changes. They speculate that the surgical procedure may have affected urine production, and the failure to clear creatinine may have resulted from brain cell deterioration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">According to the researchers, they decided to transplant both kidneys into one patient because the number of pig nephrons (a basic unit of the kidney that produces urine) needed to support a human system was unknown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong><strong>The Future of Organ Transplantation<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">The researchers state in their paper that their trial overcame many barriers to human xenotransplantation trials, while also identifying areas where more research is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">&#8220;Our study suggests that major barriers to human xenotransplantation have been overcome and identifies where new knowledge is required to optimise human xenotransplantation outcomes,&#8221; they write.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Xenotransplantation research is advancing quickly, and it is viewed as a potential solution to the global organ shortage crisis. Pig organs have recently become more compatible with those of humans, thanks to CRISPR and other genetic editing technologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Pigs are commonly used for xenotransplantation procedures because they are easier to raise and their organs reach adult human size by six months of age.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">At the University of Maryland earlier this year, a genetically modified pig&#8217;s heart was successfully transplanted into a human for the first time. A pig&#8217;s kidney was temporarily externally attached to a patient in New York last year and worked for 54 hours. Pig valves are increasingly being used in the hearts of human patients, and porcine pancreatic tissues have also been grafted onto humans.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Surgeons at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, US, transplanted the kidneys of a genetically engineered pig into a 57-year-old brain-dead man in a scientific first.
