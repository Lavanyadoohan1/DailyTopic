<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first images of Etihad Rails are now available. These images depict the design and appearance of the passenger trains operated by Ethiad Rail in the United Arab Emirates. The carriages on these trains are silver and grey with a red Etihad Rail logo. These images also show the interiors, providing the first look at what these trains will be like on the inside.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to reports, these trains will connect 11 cities and areas across the UAE, from Al Sila (in the west) to Fujairah (northern part). The trains will travel at a speed of 200 kmph between these points, seating 400 people inside the carriages.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to Etihad Rail, the stations will be designed to celebrate regional traditions. Additionally, the idea is to build some of the stations in cities, though the location is not yet finalized. “We see the stations as urban centers where people can gather,” said Ahmed Al Hashemi, executive director of Etihad Rail passengers, in a statement.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">These trains carriages will be equipped with Wi-Fi, charging stations, entertainment systems, and food and beverages for everyone in the UAE. In addition, for convenience, the rail system will be integrated with other modes of public transportation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The train is expected to take fifty minutes to travel from Abu Dhabi to Dubai and around 100 minutes to travel from Abu Dhabi to Fujairah. The entire system is expected to generate Dh 23 billion in profits and provide approximately 9,000 jobs.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Etihad Rail was founded in 2009, and the passenger rail service was announced in December of last year. However, no information about the launch has been released as of yet.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Surgeons at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, US, transplanted the kidneys of a genetically engineered pig into a 57-year-old brain-dead man in a scientific first.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The kidneys began producing urine within 23 minutes and continued to function for the duration of the experiment, lasting 74 hours. The procedure was described in a scientific paper published on January 20 in the American Journal of Transplantation — the first time a pig-to-human transplant procedure had been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The study addressed critical safety and feasibility issues in xenotransplantation or transplanting organs from one species into another, and the findings pave the way for future and immediate clinical trials.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The pig&#8217;s organs had been genetically modified to be more compatible with human bodies and less likely to be rejected. The researchers also discovered no infection in the man caused by pig viruses.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The kidneys produced urine but were unable to remove creatinine from the blood, as a normal functioning kidney would. The researchers believe this is due to the brain injury suffered by the patient, James Parsons.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Parsons had been declared dead five days before, and the experiment was called off when other organs began to fail and he began to severely bleed 77 hours into it. At no point were the kidneys rejected.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><strong>The investigation</strong></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The &#8216;Parsons Model&#8217; is the name given by the surgeons&#8217; team to their pre-clinical model experiment, which will take place in late September 2021.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The pig&#8217;s genome had ten modifications. Two human genes were inserted to prevent rejection, two for anticoagulation (blood clot prevention), and two for immunomodulatory (immune system regulation).\</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Three pig carbohydrate antigen genes, as well as the pig growth hormone receptor gene, were deleted. Pigs that have been genetically modified in this way are also compatible with all human blood types because they lack red blood cell antigens.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Parsons had been declared dead and brain dead for five days prior to the experiment. He had suffered mild-to-moderate kidney damage as well as head trauma. His family agreed to the procedure after exhausting all other transplant options.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">While both transplanted kidneys functioned normally, one produced more urine than the other. Creatinine levels in the body did not decrease, as they normally do in healthy kidneys.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The researchers do not yet know what is causing either of these changes. They speculate that the surgical procedure may have affected urine production, and the failure to clear creatinine may have resulted from brain cell deterioration.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">According to the researchers, they decided to transplant both kidneys into one patient because the number of pig nephrons (a basic unit of the kidney that produces urine) needed to support a human system was unknown.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><strong>The Future of Organ Transplantation</strong></strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The researchers state in their paper that their trial overcame many barriers to human xenotransplantation trials, while also identifying areas where more research is needed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&#8220;Our study suggests that major barriers to human xenotransplantation have been overcome and identifies where new knowledge is required to optimise human xenotransplantation outcomes,&#8221; they write.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Xenotransplantation research is advancing quickly, and it is viewed as a potential solution to the global organ shortage crisis. Pig organs have recently become more compatible with those of humans, thanks to CRISPR and other genetic editing technologies.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Pigs are commonly used for xenotransplantation procedures because they are easier to raise and their organs reach adult human size by six months of age.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">At the University of Maryland earlier this year, a genetically modified pig&#8217;s heart was successfully transplanted into a human for the first time. A pig&#8217;s kidney was temporarily externally attached to a patient in New York last year and worked for 54 hours. Pig valves are increasingly being used in the hearts of human patients, and porcine pancreatic tissues have also been grafted onto humans.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Nature has a few tricks up her sleeve. It can catch you off guard at any time. One such occasion occurred recently in the United States, when dozens of bizarre sand sculptures were spotted near Lake Michigan.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">What makes these&#8217;sand hoodoos&#8217;, which dotted the shoreline, unique is that they were formed by a combination of strong wind, frozen moisture in the sand, and erosion.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The term &#8220;sand hoodoos&#8221; refers to naturally formed, thin rock spires that are typically found in canyons.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">These sculptures could stand up to 15 inches tall. They were discovered in the area, which is approximately 82 miles from Grand Rapids.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sand hoodoos have a short lifespan because they collapse within hours as the weather warms throughout the day.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Visitors to the Lake Michigan beach near St Joseph, Michigan, were in for a treat when they saw the unusual sight.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&#8220;It was like being on another planet.&#8221; Terri Abbott told Fox Weather, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen anything like them, and I spend a lot of time there.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Abbott had seen them in Tescornia Park in the city of southwestern Michigan.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&#8220;I believe what happened is that the sand became frozen. Then, a few weeks ago, we had a major storm with high winds pass through. &#8220;The wind blew along the beach, blasting out the areas that were less frozen,&#8221; said Alan Arbogast, Geology Chairman at Michigan State University.</p>

<ul class="has-medium-font-size"><li>Reliance Jio, India&#8217;s largest telecom provider, announced its Q3 FY22 results on Friday.</li><li>Jio&#8217;s average revenue per user has risen above 150 in the last three months, matching the level seen exactly a year ago, before the second wave of COVID-19 hit the country.</li><li>Despite this, Jio&#8217;s subscriber count fell from the previous quarter.</li></ul>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Reliance Jio, India&#8217;s largest telecom company, announced its financial results for the period October to December 2021, revealing strong momentum in the amount it earns on average from each subscriber, also known as ARPU (average revenue per user).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Between October and December 2021, Reliance Jio&#8217;s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased by 18%, far exceeding analyst expectations of 4-5% growth.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Surprisingly, this is Jio&#8217;s highest ARPU to date, surpassing the December 2020 figure. This is after accounting for the change in the IUC (interconnect usage charges) regime, which went into effect in January 2021 and resulted in a drop in ARPU numbers for all telecom companies.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">After ignoring analyst warnings for several months, Jio finally raised tariffs after rivals Airtel and Vodafone Idea announced 20-25 percent hikes. Jio&#8217;s tariffs remain the lowest of the three, and JP Morgan analysts expect the benefits of this increase to be realized only in the June 2022 quarter.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, the Mukesh Ambani-led telco has maintained its subscriber lead over Airtel and Vodafone Idea. The introduction of the low-cost JioPhone Next has helped the telco maintain its lead over rival Airtel.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Jio reported a total customer base of 421 million subscribers, a decrease from the previous quarter&#8217;s figure of 430 million. However, this is still lower than the figure from the June quarter.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Last quarter&#8217;s revenue for Reliance Jio</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Jio&#8217;s profit increased by 2% between October and December 2021, rising to 3,795 crores from 3,728 crores in the previous quarter. On a year-over-year basis, its profit increased by nearly 9%. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="799" height="451" src="https://jacob2705.github.io/DailyTopic/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AAT0Oey.png" alt="" class="wp-image-287"/></figure></div>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This quarter, both data and voice usage increased significantly.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When compared to the previous quarter, data traffic increased by nearly 6%. During the quarter, the average data usage per user was 18.4GB, up from 17.6GB the previous quarter.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Voice usage increased to 901 minutes from 840 minutes the previous quarter.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">After Pant-115-run Rahul&#8217;s fourth-wicket stand, India will be hard-pressed to score more than 300 in the second and penultimate ODI. While Pant was out for 85, missing out on a century, Rahul fell for a 79-ball 55 against the run of play.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">India already lost the first One-Day International (ODI) on Wednesday. The visitors were restricted for 265-8 in their full quota of overs while chasing 297 and will need to up their game to level the series.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The largest space telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, has used all of its hexagonal mirror segments. The delicate operation of removing the individual mirror segments of the James Webb observatory from their launch positions took nearly a week. NASA stated that its engineers sent commands to the motors, known as actuators, to slowly move each segment about half the length of a paper clip in order to free the mirrors from their launch restraints and provide enough space for mirror alignment.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The James Webb space telescope will now begin its orbit around the sun. The telescope will be nearly one million miles from Earth. Erin Wolf, the mission&#8217;s program manager, also described how the mirrors on the James Webb observatory were moved and tested. He claimed that the motors had completed over a million revolutions this week. The team relocated all 132 actuators in the primary and secondary mirror segments. He explained that the actuators free the mirrors from their launch restraints and give each segment space to be adjusted later in other directions by using six motors that deploy each segment about half the length of a paper clip.</p>



<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our mirror segment deployments are complete! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br><br>Using motors, each segment was moved out about half the length of a paper clip to clear the mirrors from their launch restraints and give each segment enough space for mirror alignment. <a href="https://t.co/XWbVLQuch1">https://t.co/XWbVLQuch1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnfoldTheUniverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UnfoldTheUniverse</a> <a href="https://t.co/d121DHldiX">pic.twitter.com/d121DHldiX</a></p>&mdash; NASA Webb Telescope (@NASAWebb) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAWebb/status/1483944717826068484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The alignment process will now take about three months. NASA will fire the James Webb telescope&#8217;s thrusters on January 24 to propel it into its orbit around the sun. The mission will be live-streamed on NASA&#8217;s Science Live website, as well as on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left has-medium-font-size">The launch of the Samsung Galaxy S22 series is just around the corner, with the company confirming that its Unpacked 2022 event will take place in February. Samsung promises that the next generation flagships will provide a better user experience. Samsung President TM Roh hinted in a blog post that the Galaxy S series could include a Note-series-like device as well. It is also expected to unveil its new Galaxy Tab S8 tablets at the event. Here&#8217;s a rundown of everything Samsung is expected to reveal next month.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The date of the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2022 event has been leaked.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">While the company has yet to confirm the event date, Ice Universe, a well-known leaker, claimed on Weibo that Samsung will hold its Galaxy Unpacked 2022 event on February 9. However, according to a report in the Korean publication DDaily, the event could begin on February 8. According to reports, the event will begin at 23:00 PM CST, which is 8:30 PM in India.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>What can we expect from the Samsung Unpacked 2022 event?</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is widely rumored to be the new Samsung Galaxy Note series phone this year, something that the company&#8217;s President has also hinted at. The terms &#8220;notable S series&#8221; and &#8220;the next evolution of Galaxy&#8221; both refer to the same thing. The company has also posted a short video on YouTube, implying that the brand intends to offer a mix of Galaxy S and Note series, which the Galaxy S22 Ultra may offer.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&#8220;At Unpacked in February 2022, we&#8217;ll unveil the most notable S series device we&#8217;ve ever created.&#8221; &#8220;The next generation of Galaxy S is here, combining the best of our Samsung Galaxy into one ultimate device,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&#8220;We understand that many of you were disappointed when Samsung did not release a new Galaxy Note last year. You adored the Galaxy Note series&#8217; unrivaled creativity and efficiency, which allowed you to transition from gaming nirvana to high-octane productivity in the blink of an eye. You gushed about the lifelike S Pen, which many compare to writing with ink on paper. And we haven&#8217;t forgotten about the things you enjoy,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Samsung is expected to release three smartphones this year, including the Galaxy S22, Galaxy S22 Plus, and Galaxy S22 Ultra. The top-tier Ultra model is said to have a unique design. It may resemble Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Note phablets and include an S-Pen slot. According to previous rumors and leaks, this one will also have a curved display, similar to the Galaxy Note 20. The Galaxy S22 Ultra may have a large 6.81-inch screen. A 5,000mAh battery and a 108-megapixel quad-camera setup were also visible. A 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 10-megapixel 10x telephoto camera, and a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera are said to be included.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In some countries, all three Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphones will most likely be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. In India, the company could release devices with its new Exynos 2200 SoC and AMD graphics.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Galaxy S22 and its Plus variant are also expected to get camera upgrades, such as a beefier primary camera and improved optical zoom. Both handsets are expected to keep the old design and include a 50MP GN5 primary camera on the back. The standard model is expected to have a 6.01-inch screen, while the Plus is expected to have a 6.55-inch display.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Roland Quandt, a tipster, recently suggested that the company&#8217;s 2022 flagship could finally offer faster-charging speeds. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra model is expected to support 45W charging. However, because Samsung does not include a charger in the box of its flagship phones, the charging brick may have to be purchased separately. Furthermore, the other two models are said to have only 25W fast charging, which is similar to older models.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 series, in addition to the Galaxy S22 series, is expected to make its debut at the upcoming Unpacked 2022 event. While few details are known about the tablet&#8217;s specifications, it is expected to be powered by a Snapdragon 888 or Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. Three models could be unveiled by the company. The standard model is expected to have an 11.6-inch screen, while the Plus model may have a 12-inch screen. The Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra could have a massive 14.6-inch screen when it launches.</p>
